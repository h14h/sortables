# Sortable Rows

This repo is an attempt to create a custom `Sortable.Flex` strategy for
ordering items across rows.

The goal is to support the following:

- [x] Reordering items within their row (1pt)
- [x] Reordering entire rows at once (2pt)
  - [x] Share active position across items (+1pt)
- [ ] Removing items from a row into a new row (2pt)
- [ ] Moving standalone items into an "open" row (3pt)
- [ ] Polish (2pt)

> [!NOTE]
> The above estimates do not include time spent on initial prototype setup and
  learning the RN Sortables custom ordering strategy API
